This is mostly a proof of concept, however it's fully playable, just limited to only English input and little QoL features.

## How to use

1. Install the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin for desktop Anki client.
2. Download the latest build from releases page or open the project in Godot (4.4+) editor.
3. Open the deck you want to study and run the game!

## Features
There are obviously a lot of QoL stuff missing, so here are a few things that I'd like to add when I have time:
- [x] Basic Anki card  and answer integration 
- [x] Fuzzy answer matching
- [ ] Independent Godot extension for AnkiConnect
- [ ] Support for custom card formats
- [ ] Deck selection UI
- [ ] Persistent settings (formats, default AnkiConnect port and more)
- [ ] Support for multilanguage input (it's hard to do Korean or Chinese input in Godot natively, so I'd need a workaround for that)
